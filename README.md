# Michael's Music Anthology
A nerdy website that tracks stats about the music I listen to.

## How it works
-Google Sheets is used as a database to store information about songs and albums (artist, release year, etc.)\
-Google Cloud Console API is used to pull the data from a public sheet and process various statistics using JavaScript\
-Google Charts API is used to create graphs
